# CQ RP Icons

Note: Characters who use different names with significantly different appearances (e.g. Saturday and Panpipe) have separate folders for each identity. Characters who wear different costumes for significant periods of time without impersonating anyone (e.g. Gary and Bacon) have sorted folders under a single main folder.

This repository has icons from:
- The comic, up to page 217 (in progress)
- The Rise and Fall of Super Peridot
- Cucumber Dressed
- Gamemasterz
- Bonus comics from the original print books 1-3
